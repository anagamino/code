## Shared files
Files I want to share between my computers, most of all config config files.

sync_config.sh syncs your local config with the remote one. This includes:
    * Update the files from repo (pull)
    * Send local commit to repo (push)
    * Install the files (using links)
    * Show local changes
        
    
The old files are preserve just in case on ~/.old_config/ dir. 

In fact, there are more than plain config files there, the idea is to put there 
any thing I want to have  in all my environments.
